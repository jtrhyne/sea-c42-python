##About Me##
Born in San Francisco but have lived in or near Seattle since I was four. I've always been interested in computers
but did consider a career in tech until a couple years ago, and have been learning ever since!

##Interests##
Sailing, motorcycles, mountaineering and coding. 

##Why Python, and why now?##
Data science and machine learning are fascinating. Specifically I'm interested in the data involved in personal
transportation. Up until recently I was trying to make my way as a merchant mariner, but found it somewhat boring,
to be completely honest.
